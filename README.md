# Scroll Up Manager for WHMCS
If your pages are long winded, it’s a good idea to provide viewers with an easy way to quickly/automatically scroll back to the top of the page. That’s is exactly what this module does. It displays a stationary control on user’s screen predefined by Admin. When clicked on, it gently scrolls the page back up to the top. Instead of always being visible on the user’s screen, this plugin lets you specify how far down the page the user is at (in pixels) before revealing the control. Admin can also choose one of available styles.
